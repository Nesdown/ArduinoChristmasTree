# ArduinoChristmasTree
Simple project of a "Christmas Tree" based on Arduino.

This sketch uses an opensource library TMRPCM in work with speaker and standart SD library for SD card.
This is an example of "Christmas Tree" based on Arduino. It uses LEDs to imitate garland and speaker to play random holiday songs that are downloaded on a SD card.
Note that audiofiles should be located in root of SD-card without any folders. Also, audiofiles should have ".wav" format and numbers from 1 to 30 as names.
For example: 
1.wav
2.wav
3.wav
...
30.wav
